<p>This documentation is for the <strong>latest release</strong> version of
 Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK (<code class="highlighter-rouge">scanbot-web-sdk@2.x</code>).</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Since the Web SDK is based on WebAssembly, older browsers are unfortunately not supported. 
WebAssembly as well as Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK are supported as of the following versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edge 16+</li>
  <li>Firefox 53+</li>
  <li>Chrome 57+</li>
  <li>Safari 11+</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK is optimized for mobile browsers.
The latest versions of the following mobile browsers are supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Android: Chrome, Firefox, Edge</li>
  <li>On iOS 11+: Safari only</li>
</ul>

<p>More information available <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=webassembly">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that Chrome and Firefox on iOS still use the iOS WebKit rendering engine. 
<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=752458">getUserMedia is only available in Safari, not other browsers on 
iOS</a>.
This is subject to change, but as of writing this (Aug 2020), 
on iOS only Safari is supported and no release date 
for the feature on other browsers has been confirmed.</p>

<h3 id="example-apps">Example Apps</h3>

<p>Check out our Angular, React and plain JS example apps on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/doo/scanbot-sdk-example-web">scanbot-sdk-example-web</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding-the-dependency">Adding the Dependency</h3>

<p>Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK is available as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scanbot-web-sdk">package</a>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install scanbot-web-sdk --save
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In webpack-based projects you can import the package like so:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import ScanbotSDK from 'scanbot-web-sdk/webpack'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will ensure that the web worker and WebAssembly components are automatically copied over by webpack into the webpack output folder.</p>

<p>If you want to manually handle those components, import the SDK without the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/webpack</code> suffix:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import ScanbotSDK from 'scanbot-web-sdk'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, make sure to copy the following files from the package to your web folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK.Core.js</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK.Asm.wasm</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The npm package contains typings under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@types</code> directory, 
so you can import it in your preferred typescript project,
as well as the minified bundle (will even work with vanilla javascript) in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> directory.</p>

<p>If you don’t use a bundler (webpack, etc.) in your project, you can put a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script src="ScanbotSDK.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag
in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. The script puts the SDK entry point into a global variable named <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK</code>. Copy <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK.min.js</code>
from the package’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> folder to your web folder.</p>

<h3 id="initializing-the-sdk">Initializing the SDK</h3>

<p>In order to run the Scanbot SDK plugin functionality within your production app, 
you have to purchase and use a valid Scanbot SDK license.
The SDK will run for one minute in trial mode without a license.</p>

<p>Scanbot SDK must be initialized before use.
If you wish to add a custom engine location, e.g. beta version 
or a specific path to the web worker components,
you can also specify the engine location:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">myLicenseKey</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">scanbotSDK</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">ScanbotSDK</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">initialize</span><span class="p">({</span>
    <span class="na">licenseKey</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">myLicenseKey</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="c1">// optional engine path where ScanbotSDK.Core.js and ScanbotSDK.Asm.wasm are served</span>
    <span class="na">engine</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">static/js/</span><span class="dl">"</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Leave the license key empty to enter the trial mode of one minute.</p>

<p>Please contact our <a href="mailto:sdk@scanbot.io">sales team</a> to request a free 30-day SDK trial license key.</p>

<p>The initializer also serves as the main entry point of the SDK, 
meaning that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">scanbotSDK</code> object returned upon <code class="highlighter-rouge">initialize</code>
serves as your entry point to use any other SDK features.</p>

<h3 id="document-scanner-ui">Document Scanner UI</h3>

<h4 id="configuration--styling">Configuration &amp; Styling</h4>

<p>In order to start the document scanner, we must first create a 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">DocumentScannerConfiguration</code> object, or simply a dictionary in vanilla javascript, as follows.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">containerId</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">containerId</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The only required property is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">containerId</code>, string, 
that should match the container where you want the document scanner to pop up.</p>

<p>The configuration object also accepts the following parameters (values displayed are defaults):</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">acceptedAngleScore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">75</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nx">acceptedSizeScore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">75</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nx">autoCaptureSensitivity</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">0.66</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nx">autoCaptureEnabled</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="nx">ignoreBadAspectRatio</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, you can also use the configuration object for react-like styling.
It accepts the following parameters for document outline, hint text label and capture button color
(values displayed are defaults):</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that if you wish to do your styling in css, and not in a reactive design pattern,
you are more than welcome to.</p>

<p>The defaults bundled with the SDK, that you are welcome to override, are as follows:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">.scanbot-document-outline</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>The capture/shutter button can be repositioned by overriding the following css class:</p>

    <span class="c">/* ... */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moreover, the hint texts can also be configured via the same configuration object
(values displayed are defaults):</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The document scanner works at the maximum available camera resolution for the highest quality scans by default.
You can further configure the camera video stream by specifying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">videoConstraints</code> property of
the document scanner configuration. The video constraints are directly given to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a></p>

<p>The default video constraints are as follows:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">videoConstraints</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">MediaTrackConstraints</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">facingMode</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">environment</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">resizeMode</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">none</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">ideal</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3840</span> <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="na">height</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">ideal</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2160</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Call <code class="highlighter-rouge">documentScanner.dispose()</code> to stop the scanner and release all resources.</p>

<h4 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h4>

<p>To receive detection results define <code class="highlighter-rouge">onDocumentDetected</code> in the configuration:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">onDocumentDetected</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Detected Document:</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">result</code> object contains the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">detectionStatus</code> – contains the same keys as the the hint texts mentioned earlier</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code> – boolean, whether detection was successful or not</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">original</code> – If <code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code>, contains the cropped document ArrayBuffer (<code class="highlighter-rouge">UInt8Array</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cropped</code> – If <code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code>, contains the cropped document ArrayBuffer (<code class="highlighter-rouge">UInt8Array</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">polygon</code> – The page’s cropping polygon as calculated by a document detection operation</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this will be called every time a document is detected, 
until you stop detection or dispose the camera.</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-scanner">Creating the Scanner</h4>

<p>After you’re done configuring the scanner, 
simply refer back to your SDK object and create the scanner object as follows:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">documentScanner</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">scanbotSDK</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createDocumentScanner</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">config</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An exception is thrown if camera streaming is not supported or the user blocks the camera.</p>

<h4 id="handling-automatic-capture">Handling Automatic Capture</h4>

<p>If you wish to do image processing between document captures, or find the document scanner a wee bit too trigger-happy, 
(which is plausible on high-end devices) there is the option to disable automatic capture on the fly.</p>

<p>You can also use these calls create your own custom auto-capture on/off switch.</p>

<p>Call to disable auto-capture:</p>
<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">documentScanner</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">disableAutoCapture</span><span class="p">();</span>

<h3 id="cropping-ui">Cropping UI</h3>

<h4 id="configuration">Configuration</h4>

<p>ScanbotSDK Cropping View takes a <code class="highlighter-rouge">CroppingViewConfiguration</code> parameter. It has the following format:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">?:</span> <span class="nx">CroppingViewStyle</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="styling">Styling</h4>

<p>The styling options and default values of the Cropping View are the following:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">padding</span><span class="p">?:</span> <span class="nx">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">magneticLines</code> style exists only because it is because it is somewhat of an experimental feature, 
there’s room for improvement and optimization. See if it meets your requirements in its current form</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-view">Creating the View</h4>

<p>To open the cropping view, simply call the SDK function with the configuration object:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">croppingView</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">scanbotSDK</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">openCroppingView</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should store the cropping view object in a globally accessible location,
as additional cropping functions are functions of that object.</p>

<h4 id="api">API</h4>

<p>ScanbotSDK Cropping View classical component contains the following public functions:</p>

<p>• <code class="highlighter-rouge">rotate(rotations: number): Promise&lt;void&gt;;</code></p>

<p>The number of clockwise rotations you wish to apply to your image.</p>

<p>• <code class="highlighter-rouge">detect(): Promise&lt;void&gt;;</code></p>

<p>If you’re not happy with the detected polygon, you can re-detect and re-apply the polygon from the detected document</p>

<p>• <code class="highlighter-rouge">apply(): Promise&lt;DetectionResult&gt;;</code></p>

<p>If you are happy with the polygon and the rotations, apply the changes and receive your new detection detection result</p>

<p>• <code class="highlighter-rouge">dispose(): void;</code></p>

<p>Dispose the Cropping View element if you’re done.</p>

<h3 id="image-filters">Image Filters</h3>

<p>You can also apply filters to images. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">scanbotSDK</code> object contains the following function:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">async</span> <span class="nx">applyFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">imageBuffer</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">ArrayBuffer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">filterType</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">ImageFilter</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="nb">Promise</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">ArrayBuffer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you can simply pass the image object from your <code class="highlighter-rouge">DetectionResult</code> to the filter function 
and return the image with the filter.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ArrayBuffer</code> in this context is equal to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Uint8Array</code> image in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">DetectionResult</code> object.</p>

<p>Scanbot WebSDK allows the following filter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binarization filters:
    <ul>
      <li>Binarized</li>
      <li>OtsuBinarization</li>
      <li>PureBinarized</li>
      <li>LowLightBinarization</li>
      <li>LowLightBinarization2</li>
      <li>DeepBinarization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Color filters:
    <ul>
      <li>Color</li>
      <li>Gray</li>
      <li>ColorDocument</li>
      <li>BlackAndWhite</li>
      <li>EdgeHighlight</li>
      <li>Trinarization</li>
      <li>LightMapNormalization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They are available under <code class="highlighter-rouge">BinarizationFilter</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ColorFilter</code> enumerations, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="pdf-generation">PDF Generation</h3>

<p>ScanbotSDK also offers functionality for PDF generation. Create the appropriate generator as follows:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">PdfGenerationOptions</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">standardPaperSize</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">A4</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="na">landscape</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="na">dpi</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">};</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">generator</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">scanbotSDK</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">beginPdf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If a DPI is provided, then that value is used. 
If the value is not given or that value is too small for the entire image to fit on the page, 
then the smallest possible DPI value is chosen so that the entire image fits on the page.</p>

<p>This API may not seem, at fast glance, very straightforward. However, in order to allow for memory optimization, 
you can load an image from storage one at a time and add it to the generator:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">generator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addPage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">image</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When all images have been added, <code class="highlighter-rouge">complete</code> the transaction and receive the resulting byte array:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">bytes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">generator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">complete</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example, you can force the download of the pages in the browser via:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">static</span> <span class="nx">saveBytes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">extension</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">style</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">display: none</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">blob</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Blob</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">type</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">`application/</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">extension</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">URL</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createObjectURL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">blob</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">download</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">URL</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">revokeObjectURL</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then call it as such:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">saveBytes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">bytes</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">generated.pdf</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: if the return type of the function is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise</code>, it is asynchronous needs to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">await</code>ed</p>

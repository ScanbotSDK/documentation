<p>This documentation is for the <strong>latest release</strong> version of
 Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK (<code class="highlighter-rouge">scanbot-web-sdk@1.x</code>).</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Since the Web SDK is based on WebAssembly, older browsers are unfortunately not supported. 
WebAssembly as well as Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK are supported as of the following versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edge 16+</li>
  <li>Firefox 53+</li>
  <li>Chrome 57+</li>
  <li>Safari 11+</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK is optimized for mobile browsers.
The latest versions of the following mobile browsers are supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Android: Chrome, Firefox, Edge</li>
  <li>On iOS 11+: Safari only</li>
</ul>

<p>More information available <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=webassembly">here</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that Chrome and Firefox on iOS still use the iOS WebKit rendering engine. 
<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=752458">getUserMedia is only available in Safari, not other browsers on 
iOS</a>.
This is subject to change, but as of writing this (Aug 2020), 
on iOS only Safari is supported and no release date 
for the feature on other browsers has been confirmed.</p>

<h3 id="example-apps">Example Apps</h3>

<p>Check out our React and plain JS example apps on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/doo/scanbot-sdk-example-web">scanbot-sdk-example-web</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adding-the-dependency">Adding the Dependency</h3>

<p>Scanbot Web Document Scanner SDK is available as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/scanbot-web-sdk">package</a>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install scanbot-web-sdk --save
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In webpack-based projects you can import the package like so:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import ScanbotSDK from 'scanbot-web-sdk/webpack'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will ensure that the web worker and WebAssembly components are automatically copied over by webpack into the webpack output folder.</p>

<p>If you want to manually handle those components, import the SDK without the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/webpack</code> suffix:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import ScanbotSDK from 'scanbot-web-sdk'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Then, make sure to copy the following files from the package to your web folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK.Core.js</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK.Asm.wasm</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The npm package contains compiled javascript with typings under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">component</code>
directory, so you can import it in your preferred typescript project,
as well as the minified bundle (will even work with vanilla javascript) in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> directory.</p>

<p>If you don’t use a bundler (webpack, etc.) in your project, you can put a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script src="ScanbotSDK.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag
in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.html</code>. The script puts the SDK entry point into a global variable named <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK</code>. Copy <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotSDK.min.js</code>
from the package’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> folder to your web folder.</p>

<h3 id="initializing-the-sdk">Initializing the SDK</h3>

<p>In order to run the Scanbot SDK plugin functionality within your production app, 
you have to purchase and use a valid Scanbot SDK license.
The SDK will run for one minute in trial mode without a license.</p>

<p>Scanbot SDK must be initialized before use.
If you wish to add a custom engine location, e.g. beta version 
or a specific path to the web worker components,
you can also specify the engine location:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const licenseKey = "";
scanbotSDK = await ScanbotSDK.initialize({
    licenseKey: licenseKey,
    engine: "static/js/"
});
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Leave the license key empty to enter trial mode.</p>

<p>The initializer also serves as the main entry point of the SDK, 
meaning that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">scanbotSDK</code> object returned upon <code class="highlighter-rouge">initialize</code>
serves as your entry point to use any other SDK features.</p>

<h3 id="document-scanner">Document Scanner</h3>

<h4 id="configuration--styling">Configuration &amp; Styling</h4>

<p>In order to start the document scanner, we must first create a 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">DocumentScannerConfiguration</code> object, or simply a dictionary in vanilla javascript, as follows.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const config = {
    containerId: containerId,
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The only required property is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">containerId</code>, string, 
that should match the container where you want the document scanner to pop up.</p>

<p>The configuration object also accepts the following parameters (values displayed are defaults):</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>acceptedAngleScore: 75,
acceptedSizeScore: 75,
autoCaptureSensitivity: 0.66,
autoCaptureEnabled: true,
ignoreBadAspectRatio: true,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Additionally, you can also use the configuration object for react-like styling.
It accepts the following parameters for document outline, hint text label and capture button color
(values displayed are defaults):</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>style: {
    outline: {
        polygon: {
            stroke: "yellow",
            strokeWidth: "2px",
            fill: "none"
        },
        label: {
            position: "absolute",
            top: "90%",
            left: "50%",
            transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
            textAlign: "center",
            backgroundColor: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)",
            color: "white",
            borderRadius: "0.25em",
            padding: "0.5em",
            fontFamily: "sans-serif",
            fontSize: "1em"
        },
        captureButton: {
            color: "white"
        }
    }
};
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that if you wish to do your styling in css, and not in a reactive design pattern,
you are more than welcome to.</p>

<p>The defaults bundled with the SDK, that you are welcome to override, are as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.scanbot-document-outline {
    stroke: yellow;
    stroke-width: 2px;
    fill: none;
}

.scanbot-document-outline-ok {
    stroke: green;
}

.scanbot-document-outline-visible {
    opacity: 1;
    transition: opacity .3s ease-in-out;
}

.scanbot-document-outline-hidden {
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity .3s ease-in-out;
}

.scanbot-document-hint-text {
    position: absolute;
    top: 90%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
    color: white;
    border-radius: 0.25em;
    padding: 0.5em;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 1em;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The capture/shutter button can be repositioned by overriding the following css class:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.scanbot-shutter-button {
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moreover, the hint texts can also be configured via the same configuration object
(values displayed are defaults):</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>text: {
    hint: {
        OK: "Don't move. Capturing document...",
        OK_SmallSize: 'Move closer',
        OK_BadAngles: 'Turn your device to&lt;br&gt;have a more rectangular outline',
        OK_BadAspectRatio: 'Wrong aspect ratio - rotate your device',
        OK_OffCenter: 'Move to the center',
        Error_NothingDetected: 'Searching for document...',
        Error_Brightness: 'Poor light&lt;br&gt;Searching for document...',
        Error_Noise: 'Noisy background&lt;br&gt;Searching for document...'
    }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The document scanner works at the maximum available camera resolution for the highest quality scans by default.
You can further configure the camera video stream by specifying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">videoConstraints</code> property of
the document scanner configuration. The video constraints are directly given to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a></p>

<p>The default video constraints are as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>videoConstraints: MediaTrackConstraints = {
    facingMode: "environment",
    resizeMode: "none",
    width: { ideal: 3840 },
    height: { ideal: 2160 }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Call <code class="highlighter-rouge">documentScanner.dispose()</code> to stop the scanner and release all resources.</p>

<h4 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h4>

<p>To receive detection results define <code class="highlighter-rouge">onDocumentDetected</code> in the configuraiton:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>onDocumentDetected: result =&gt; {
    console.log("Detected Document:", result);
},
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">result</code> object contains the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">detectionStatus</code> – contains the same keys as the the hint texts mentioned earlier</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code> – boolean, whether detection was successful or not</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">cropped</code> – If <code class="highlighter-rouge">success</code>, contains the cropped document, base64</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">polygon</code> – The page’s cropping polygon as calculated by a document detection operation</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this will be called every time a document is detected, 
until you stop detection or dispose the camera.</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-scanner">Creating the Scanner</h4>

<p>After you’re done configuring the scanner, 
simply refer back to your SDK object and create the scanner object as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>documentScanner = await scanbotSDK.createDocumentScanner(config);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An exception is thrown if camera streaming is not supported or the user blocks the camera.</p>

<h4 id="dispose">Dispose</h4>

<p>Always dispose the document scanner after it is no longer needed.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>await documentScanner.dispose();
</code></pre></div></div>

</ul>

<h4 id="no-internet-connection-required">No Internet Connection Required</h4>
<p><strong>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK works completely offline.</strong> It doesn’t even contain any networking code.
This can easily be verified by routing all networking traffic coming from the app through a proxy.
All data generated by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is only stored on the end users device and in absolutely no case 
ever transferred to a server / cloud service controlled by us.
You as the customer will need to take care of uploading the scans / data to your backend, if desired.</p>

<p>Get the latest <code class="highlighter-rouge">$scanbotBarcodeSdkVersion</code> from <a href="#releaseHistory">Release History and Changelog</a>.</p>

<h4 id="enable-multidex">Enable Multidex</h4>
<p>Make sure you have enabled <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex">multidex</a> by setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">multiDexEnabled</code> 
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> in your <strong>module-level</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">app/build.gradle</code>):</p>

<div class="language-groovy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">android</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<h4 id="abi-settings">ABI Settings</h4>
<p>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK uses native libraries under the hood and supports following 
<a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/arch.html">ABIs</a>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">arm64-v8a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>Please check and add/adjust the <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> configuration in your <strong>module-level</strong> <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file accordingly:</p>

<div class="language-groovy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">android</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7a</code>: Native libs for the ARM 32-bit architecture (older devices).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code>: In most cases both “x86” architectures can be removed for the release (production) build, 
since they are only used on emulators and on some rare devices with the Intel Atom architecture.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you need to support <strong>all</strong> architectures, we highly recommend to use the new 
<a href="https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle/">Android App Bundle</a> approach when it comes to publishing apps.</p>

<h4 id="tuning-the-android-manifest">Tuning the Android Manifest</h4>

<h4 id="camera-permission">Camera Permission</h4>

<p>Declare that your app needs camera permission by listing the permission <code class="highlighter-rouge">android.permission.CAMERA</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;uses-permission</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">"android.permission.CAMERA"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;uses-feature</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">"android.hardware.camera"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since Android 6.0 (API level 23) you also have to implement a suitable permission requesting and handling <strong>at runtime</strong>. 
For more details please see the Android docs <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting">“Request App Permissions”</a> 
as well as our basic <a href="https://github.com/doo/scanbot-sdk-example-android/blob/master/classical-components-demo/camera-view/src/main/java/io/scanbot/example/MainActivity.kt">example implementation</a>.</p>

<p>⚠️ If your Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK license has expired, calls to the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK API will return empty results. 
To prevent this you should always check for license expiration during the runtime via <code class="highlighter-rouge">licenseInfo.isValid</code>.
If this property returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code>, you should disable any usage of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK (functions, UI components, etc).</p>

<p>To handle License errors properly the <code class="highlighter-rouge">IScanbotSDKLicenseErrorHandler</code> might be used. The callback will be triggered if 
any license error has occurred. Use the following snippet to initialize Scanbot Barcode SDK with a callback.</p>

<h3 id="ready-to-use-ui-components">Ready To Use UI Components</h3>

<p>The <strong>Ready-To-Use UI</strong> (RTU UI) is a set of easy to integrate and customize high-level UI components (Activities) 
for the most common tasks in Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Barcode and QR-Code Scanner - <code class="highlighter-rouge">BarcodeScannerActivity</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The design and behavior of these ready-to-use Activities are based on our long years of experience as well as the 
feedback from our SDK customers.</p>

<h4 id="customization-of-rtu-ui">Customization of RTU UI</h4>

<ul>
  <li>UI: All colors and text resources (localization).</li>
  <li>Behavior: Enable or disable features like Flash Light, Barcode Filter, Image Snapping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: The main idea of the RTU UI is to provide a simple-to-integrate and simple-to-customize Activity components. Due to this idea there are some limitations with the possibilities of customization.
If you need more customization options you have to implement custom Activities using our “Classical SDK UI Components”.</p>

<h4 id="integration-of-rtu-ui">Integration of RTU UI</h4>

<h4 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h4>

<p>The RTU UI components are distributed as a separate package <code class="highlighter-rouge">scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk-ui</code>.

<h3 id="classical-sdk-components">Classical SDK Components</h3>

<p>Our <strong>Classical SDK Components</strong> allows you to build your custom UI Activities which are very flexible and fully customizable. 
It is a set of easy to integrate and customize Views, Handlers, Controllers, etc. which can be used in your Activities 
to implement the most common tasks in Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK.</p>

<h4 id="customization">Customization</h4>
<ul>
  <li>UI: Fully customizable</li>
  <li>Behavior: Fully customizable</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="integration-of-classical-sdk-components">Integration of Classical SDK Components</h4>

<p>Use the classes <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BarcodeDetectorFrameHandler</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeDetector</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">BarcodeAutoSnappingController</code> 
to build a custom scanner UI for Barcode and QR-Code scanning.</p>

<h4 id="scanbotcameraview">ScanbotCameraView</h4>

<p>The Android camera API might seem to be very tricky and far from being developer-friendly (in fact, very far). 
To help you avoid the same issues which we have encountered while developing Scanbot SDK, we created the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code>.</p>

<p>Add it to your layout, which is as simple as:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;io.scanbot.sdk.camera.ScanbotCameraView</span>
        <span class="na">android:id=</span><span class="s">"@+id/camera"</span>
        <span class="na">android:layout_width=</span><span class="s">"match_parent"</span>
        <span class="na">android:layout_height=</span><span class="s">"match_parent"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Delegate the methods <code class="highlighter-rouge">onResume</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">onPause</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> class (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Fragment</code>) to <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code>:</p>

<div class="language-kotlin highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">MyActivity</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nc">AppCompatActivity</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">onResume</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">?.</span><span class="nf">onResume</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">override</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="nf">onPause</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">onPause</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">?.</span><span class="nf">onPause</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is it! You can start your app and you should see the camera preview.</p>

<p><strong>Preview Mode</strong></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code> supports 2 preview modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">CameraPreviewMode.FIT_IN</code> - in this mode camera preview frames will be downscaled to the layout view size. Full preview frame content will be visible, but unused edges could be appeared in the preview layout.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">CameraPreviewMode.FILL_IN</code> - in this mode camera preview frames fill the layout view. The preview frames may contain additional content on the edges that was not visible in the preview layout.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code> uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">FILL_IN</code> mode. You can change it using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cameraView.setPreviewMode(CameraPreviewMode mode)</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-focus Sound and Shutter Sound</strong></p>

<p>You can enable/disable auto-focus event system and shutter sounds using setters in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code>.</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setCameraOpenCallback</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">CameraOpenCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">cameraView.setShutterSound(boolean enabled)</code> set the camera shutter sound state. By default - <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>, the camera plays the system-defined camera shutter sound when takePicture() is called.</p>

<p>Note that devices may not always allow disabling the camera shutter sound. If the shutter sound state cannot be set to the desired value, this method will be ignored.
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.html#enableShutterSound(boolean)</p>

<p>Also, it is supported only with Android API 17+.</p>

<h4 id="continuous-focus-mode">Continuous Focus Mode</h4>

<p>For most use cases it is recommended to enable the “Continuous Focus Mode” of the Camera. Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">continuousFocus()</code> method of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code> for this. It should be called from the main thread and only when camera is opened (CameraOpenCallback):</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">cameraView</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">ScanbotCameraView</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">findViewById</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="no">R</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">camera</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setCameraOpenCallback</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">CameraOpenCallback</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nd">@Override</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onCameraOpened</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">postDelayed</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Runnable</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
            <span class="nd">@Override</span>
            <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">run</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
                <span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">continuousFocus</span><span class="o">();</span>
            <span class="o">}</span>
        <span class="o">},</span> <span class="mi">700</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The Continuous Focus Mode will be automatically disabled</p>

<ul>
  <li>after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">autoFocus</code> method call,</li>
  <li>after a tap on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code> to perform the autoFocus,</li>
  <li>or after the <code class="highlighter-rouge">takePicture</code> event.</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases you have to call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">continuousFocus()</code> method again to re-enable the Continuous Focus Mode.</p>

<p><strong>Orientation Lock</strong></p>

<p>By default the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code> will create pictures with orientation based on the current device orientation. 
It is important to understand that the orientation of the taken picture is independent of the locked orientation mode 
of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code>!</p>

<p>For example: if you just lock the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> to portrait mode, the orientation of the taken image will still be 
based on the current device orientation!</p>

<p>To apply a real orientation lock in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code>, you can use the following methods: 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cameraView.lockToLandscape(boolean lockPicture)</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">cameraView.lockToPortrait(boolean lockPicture)</code> to lock 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Activity</code> <strong>and</strong> the taken picture to a desired orientation:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@Override</span>
<span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onCreate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Bundle</span> <span class="n">savedInstanceState</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// ...</span>

    <span class="c1">// Lock the orientation of the Activity as well as the orientation of the taken picture to portrait:</span>
    <span class="n">cameraView</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">lockToPortrait</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">);</span>

    <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="full-example-of-a-custom-activity">Full Example of a Custom Activity</h4>

<p>As a final step, you have to connect the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotCameraView</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">BarcodeDetectorFrameHandler</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">BarcodeAutoSnappingController</code>.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeDetector</code> can be used to detect and parse barcodes from still images (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Bitmap</code>), 
e.g. JPG files from photo library or other sources.</p>

<p>Please see this example implementation of a fully customizable Activity in our demo:</p>

<p>👉 <a href="https://github.com/doo/scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk-example-android/blob/master/example_app/src/main/java/io/scanbot/example/sdk/barcode/ui/QRScanCameraViewActivity.kt">QRScanCameraViewActivity.kt</a></p>

<h3 id="proguard">ProGuard</h3>

<p>If you use ProGuard for your release builds, please add the following ProGuard rules for all Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Packages:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-keep public class io.scanbot.sdk.ui.** { *; }

-keep public class io.scanbot.sap.SapManager { *; }

-keeppackagenames io.scanbot.barcodescanner.**

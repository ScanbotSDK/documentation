<h4 id="no-internet-connection-required">No Internet Connection Required</h4>
<p><strong>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK works completely offline.</strong> It does not even contain any networking code.
This can easily be verified by routing all networking traffic coming from the app through a proxy.
All data generated by the Scanbot Barcode SDK is only stored on the end user’s device
and in absolutely no case ever transferred to a server / cloud service controlled by us.
You as the customer will need to take care of uploading the scans / data to your backend, if desired.</p>

<h4 id="simulators--emulators">Simulators / Emulators</h4>
<p>While it is possible to test your App with the Scanbot Barcode SDK module on simulators/emulators,
we strongly recommend using real Android/iOS devices. Depending on the emulated Camera,
you may not be able to test/evaluate the full functionality of the Scanbot Barcode SDK module.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="android-setup">Android Setup</h4>

<p><strong>Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Maven Repositories</strong></p>

<p>This React Native module depends on the native Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Android.
The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Android is distributed through our private Maven repositories.
Please add these repositories in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">android/build.gradle</code> file in the section <code class="highlighter-rouge">allprojects &gt; repositories</code>:</p>

<div class="language-groovy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">allprojects</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Enable Multidex</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you have enabled <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex">multidex</a>
by setting <code class="highlighter-rouge">multiDexEnabled</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">android/app/build.gradle</code> file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    multiDexEnabled true
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also add the following config in the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file to avoid conflicts with the lib filename <code class="highlighter-rouge">libc++_shared.so</code>,
which is used by React Native as well as by many other 3rd-party modules:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>android {
  ...
  packagingOptions {
      pickFirst '**/libc++_shared.so'
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="ios-setup">iOS Setup</h4>

<p>Integration can be done only via <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>.</p>

<p>In your <code class="highlighter-rouge">ios/Podfile</code> add the “RNScanbotSDK” pod:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pod 'RNScanbotBarcodeSDK', :podspec =&gt; '../node_modules/react-native-scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk/react-native-scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk.podspec'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The pod <code class="highlighter-rouge">RNScanbotBarcodeSDK</code> defines a dependency to the pod
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK</code> which is the native Scanbot Barcode SDK iOS Framework.</p>

<p>Run:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd ios/
$ pod install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That is it, no manual linking required anymore! Just open the Xcode workspace (<code class="highlighter-rouge">.xcworkspace</code>) and you should be able
to build the native Scanbot Barcode SDK linked via CocoaPods.</p>

<h4 id="permissions">Permissions</h4>

<p>In order to operate correctly an application that utilizes the ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK module
must have all required permissions to your App. Here is a listing of those permissions:</p>

<p><strong>Android</strong> (must be added in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code> file)</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" /&gt;</code> - This permission is used for the camera views.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" /&gt;</code> - Camera hardware features.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>iOS</strong> (must be added in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Info.plist</code> file)</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">NSCameraUsageDescription</code> - <em>“Privacy - Camera Usage Description”</em>.
Describe why your app wants to access the device’s camera.</li>

<h4 id="license-key">License Key</h4>
<p>In order to run the Scanbot Barcode SDK functionality within your
production app you have to purchase and use a valid Scanbot Barcode SDK license.</p>

<p>Each license key is valid only for a given app bundle identifier. If your license has expired any calls
of the Scanbot Barcode SDK will terminate your app.</p>

<p>Example code for defining and using the license key:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Please note: this is just an example license key string (it is not a valid license)</span>

<h4 id="trial-license">Trial License</h4>
<p>The Scanbot Barcode SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!
To get an unrestricted, “no-strings-attached” 30-day trial license,
please submit the <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk/trial.html">Trial License Form</a> on our website.</p>

<p>Please kindly note that a trial license can only be used in a <strong>development and staging environment</strong>.
You are <strong>not allowed to publish</strong> your app to the App Store,
Play Store or any 3rd party Android App Store with a trial license.</p>

<h4 id="purchase-a-production-license">Purchase a Production License</h4>
<p>You can check and purchase the Scanbot SDK licenses here: <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk.html">https://scanbot.io/sdk.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="app-identifier">App Identifier</h4>
<p>Every app has a unique identifier (sometimes also known as “bundle identifier” or “application ID”).
Your license will be bound to this identifier.
To request a trial license or purchase a production license you have to provide us the bundle identifier of your app.</p>

<h4 id="logging">Logging</h4>
<p>When initializing the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK you can enable logging of the SDK. By default logging is disabled.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">licenseKey</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">myLicenseKey</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">promise</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">initializeSdk</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Android logs are printed into <em>LogCat</em> as well as saved on the device.
You can find them in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()/debug_logs/[package_name]</code>.
Usually it is <code class="highlighter-rouge">/sdcard/debug_logs/[package_name]</code>.
The easiest way to check the log outputs on Android is to use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge (adb)</a> (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ adb -s &lt;DEVICE_ID&gt; shell "logcat"</code>).</p>

<p>On iOS all logs are printed to the console. Please use Xcode to check the log outputs.</p>

<p>You can also see application logs in the terminal by issuing <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-native log-android</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-native log-ios</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> While it may be useful for development,
<strong>consider switching logging OFF in production builds</strong> for security and performance reasons!</p>

<h3 id="updating-the-license-in-production-apps">Updating the License in Production Apps</h3>
<p>To renew an expired license or extend a valid license with new Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK features,
you will have to update your app in the App Store or Play Store.
The expiration date and the feature list of a license are contained in an encrypted data part of the license key string.
This means a renewal or extension of a license will cause a new license key string to be generated.</p>

<p><a name="ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseInfo"></a></p>
<h3 id="license-check-in-production-apps">License Check in Production Apps</h3>
<p>If your Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK license has expired,
any call of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK API will result in an error.
To prevent this, you should always check for license expiration during
the runtime by calling the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseInfo(..)</code>.
If the result object matches <code class="highlighter-rouge">{isLicenseValid: false}</code>,
you should disable any usage of the Scanbot Barcode SDK functions or UI components in your app.</p>

<p>We highly recommend implementing a suitable handling of this case in your app!</p>

<h4 id="scanbotbarcodesdkgetlicenseinfo-promiseboolean"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseInfo(): Promise&lt;boolean&gt;</code></h4>
<p>Use this function to check the current state of the license. The SDK must be initialized.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended to use the default storage location.
However, you can override the storage directory on initialization of the SDK Module.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">initializeSdk</code> method can take an optional parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code> to set a custom storage location.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">storageBaseDirectory</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">file:///some/custom/storage-dir/</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">initializeSdk</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code> must be a file URL (<code class="highlighter-rouge">'file:///...</code>)
pointing to a valid platform-specific file system path.
If this directory does not exist yet, the SDK Module will try to create it.
To work with the file system we recommend the npm module
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fs">react-native-fs</a></p>

<p>For the full demo code please check out our example app
<a href="https://github.com/doo/scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk-example-react-native">scanbot-barcode-scanner-sdk-example-react-native</a>.</p>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Note:</strong> When overriding the default storage location, make sure</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have implemented a suitable storage permissions request handling on Android</li>
  <li>you fully understand the consequences regarding the accessibility (security) of the produced document files.</li>
</ul>

<p>👉 For more details about the storage locations on Android and iOS please also see:</p>

<h4 id="storage-cleanup">Storage Cleanup</h4>

<p>There is <strong>no automatic</strong> file clean mechanism in this SDK Module,
because only your App can decide when the perfect time is
to remove the optional barcode image files produced by this SDK.</p>

<p>To avoid storage space issues caused by too many produced image files,
it is strongly recommended to implement a suitable
cleanup functionality based on the requirements of your app.
This SDK Module provides the following helper method to keep the storage clean:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#module_ScanbotBarcodeSdk.cleanup">cleanup</a> method to remove <strong>all</strong> generated barcode image files by this module.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h3>
<h4 id="scanbotbarcodesdkcleanup-promise"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.cleanup(): Promise</code></h4>

<p>By calling ths function all optional barcode image files generated by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK module will be deleted.</p>

<p><a name="fileHandling"></a></p>
<h3 id="file-handling--storage-concept">File Handling &amp; Storage Concept</h3>

<p>The Scanbot Barcode SDK module works with file URIs.
That means all input and output files (images, etc) are identified by a file URI.
Please note that a file <strong>URI</strong> is not just a file <strong>path</strong> : <code class="highlighter-rouge">"file:///some/file/path/.."</code> vs. <code class="highlighter-rouge">"/some/file/path/.."</code></p>

<p>Examples of valid file URIs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On Android: <code class="highlighter-rouge">file:///storage/emulated/0/Android/data/my.awesome.app/cache/sbsdk-temp/ce8de3c4-3c96-4ce1-b285-483d01e1dc9a.jpg</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On iOS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/D2BF9FB2-1024-4418-99B2-3709AB2C171E/Documents/sbsdk-temp/05719BF8-63DB-4C8A-9A57-25B233AED33C.jpg</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All output files generated by the Scanbot Barcode SDK module are temporary files.
We recommend copying, moving or deleting the files you get from callbacks to an appropriate storage place.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no automatic</strong> file clean mechanism in the module,
because only your App can decide when the perfect time is to remove a file.</p>

<p>To avoid storage space issues caused by temporary files please implement a suitable hook for the
<a href="#module_ScanbotBarcodeSdk.cleanup">cleanup</a> function in your App.</p>

<p><a name="productionApps"></a></p>
<h3 id="building-production-apps">Building Production Apps</h3>

<h4 id="ios">iOS</h4>
<p>The Scanbot Barcode SDK iOS Framework (included in this React Native npm package)
contains the most used architectures (<code class="highlighter-rouge">arm64, armv7, x86_64, i386</code>).
You can thus run it on most iOS devices as well as on simulators during the development phase.
To be able to submit a production build to the <strong>App Store</strong> or
a test build for <strong>TestFlight</strong> you have to remove (strip away)
the architectures <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code></strong> and <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">i386</code></strong> from the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Framework.
These architectures are only for <strong>simulators</strong> and not allowed to be submitted to <em>App Store Connect</em>.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we provide a script <code class="highlighter-rouge">strip-SBSDK-Framework.sh</code> which is part of the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK.framework</code> and can be easily integrated in the build process.
This script removes the unnecessary architectures from the frameworks binary,
code signs the framework and adds the crash symbols (dSYM) file to your app’s archive.
The final package size (IPA) of your app will then be significantly smaller than
a debug version used during the development phase.</p>

<p>To add this script in your build process,
you will need to open the Xcode workspace <code class="highlighter-rouge">.xcworkspace</code> and apply a few changes there:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">TARGETS</code> settings and open the tab <code class="highlighter-rouge">Build Phases</code>.
Add a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run Script Phase</code> via “+” button.</li>
  <li>Adjust this <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run Script Phase</code> with the following script data:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Script code</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bash "${PODS_ROOT}/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK.framework/strip-SBSDK-Framework.sh"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Script Input File</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>${PODS_ROOT}/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK.framework.dSYM
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="./assets/images/react-native_xcode_strip-script_settings.png"><img src="./assets/images/react-native_xcode_strip-script_settings.png" alt="alt text" title="Xcode Build Phases settings" /></a></p>

<h4 id="android">Android</h4>
<p>Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK uses native libraries under the hood and supports the following
<a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/arch.html">ABIs</a>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">arm64-v8a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>By default the native libraries of <strong>all</strong> these architectures will be included in the app package (APK),
which will result in a big APK file. Please consider removing support for <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> architectures.
In most cases both “x86” architectures can be removed for the release (production) build, since they are only used on
emulators and on some rare devices with the Intel Atom architecture.</p>

<p>To exclude certain ABIs from the APK, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> property in the Android Gradle settings of your project.</p>

<p>Please check and adjust the <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> configuration in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file accordingly:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    ndk {
      // a typical production configuration:
      abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>💡 However, if you need to support <strong>all</strong> architectures and to optimize the APK size, we highly recommend
checking out the <a href="https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle/"><strong>Android App Bundle</strong></a> approach.
It allows you to create and distribute dedicated and smaller APKs via the
<strong>PlayStore</strong> (basically it is similar to the iOS App Store approach).</p>

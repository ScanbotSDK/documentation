<h4 id="no-internet-connection-required">No Internet Connection Required</h4>
<p><strong>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK works completely offline.</strong> It doesn‚Äôt even contain any networking code. 
This can easily be verified by routing all networking traffic coming from the app through a proxy. 
All data generated by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is only stored on the end users device and in absolutely no case ever 
transferred to a server / cloud service controlled by us. You as the customer will need to take care of uploading 
the scans / data to your backend, if desired.</p>

<h4 id="simulators--emulators">Simulators / Emulators</h4>
<p>While it is possible to test your App with the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Plugin on simulators/emulators, we strongly recommend to use real Android/iOS devices. 
Depending on the emulated Camera you may not be able to test/evaluate the full functionality of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Plugin.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Cordova Plugin is available as an npm package 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner"><code class="highlighter-rouge">cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner</code></a>.</p>

<p>You can simply install and add it to your Cordova project by following command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or in an <a href="https://ionicframework.com">Ionic</a> based projects:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4 id="permissions">Permissions</h4>

<p>During the installation this plugin will try to add all required permissions to your projects automatically. 
Here is a listing of those permissions to verify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Android</strong> (will be added in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">AndroidManifest.xml</code> file):</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" /&gt;</code> - This permission is used for the camera views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>iOS</strong> (will be added in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Info.plist</code> file):</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">NSCameraUsageDescription</code> - <em>‚ÄúPrivacy - Camera Usage Description‚Äù</em>. As value describe why your app wants to access the camera.
By default an empty string value will be added. You can change this value in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.xml</code> file of your Cordova project - see <code class="highlighter-rouge">CAMERA_USAGE_DESCRIPTION</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="promisify"></a></p>
<h3 id="promise-based-api">Promise-based API</h3>
<p>The API as presented in the documentation uses the Cordova-style plugin callback signature, where the success and 
error callbacks are always passed as the first and second argument to each plugin method.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.promisify()</code> method returns an object that has all the functions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</code> 
but with a promisified signature, that is, where every method returns a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise</code>, instead of taking success/error 
callbacks as parameters. The promise-based API is only available when there is a global <code class="highlighter-rouge">Promise</code> function provided 
either by the runtime or by a polyfill. The arrow-style and async/await syntaxes are available only with transpilation, 
which is available by default to Ionic projects thanks to webpack and Babel.</p>

<p>An example with <code class="highlighter-rouge">initializeSdk(success, error, options)</code>:</p>

<h4 id="scanbotbarcodesdkinitializesdksuccesscallback-errorcallback-options">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.initializeSdk(successCallback, errorCallback, options)</h4>

<p>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK must be initialized before usage. Make sure to call the initialization after 
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">deviceready</code> Cordova event has been fired.</p>

<p>Following arguments can be passed as options on initialization:</p>

<p><strong>Options:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">licenseKey</code>: Your <a href="#licenseKey">license key</a> for the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">loggingEnabled</code>: Optional <a href="#logging">logging</a> flag. Recommended enabling for debug builds.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code>: Optional directory as file URI to overwrite the default <a href="#storage">storage directory</a> 
of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK. The SDK stores the optional snapped images in this folder.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
</div>

<p><a name="licenseKey"></a></p>
<h4 id="license-key">License Key</h4>
<p>In order to run the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK plugin functionality within your production app you have to purchase and use a valid Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK license.</p>

<p>Each license key is valid only for a given app bundle identifier. The license also defines which modules you are allowed to use. 
The usage of unlicensed modules will log an error to the console and terminate the app. If your license has expired any calls 
of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK plugin will terminate your app.</p>

<h4 id="trial-license">Trial License</h4>
<p>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!
To get an unrestricted ‚Äúno-strings-attached‚Äù 30 day trial license, please submit the <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk/trial.html">Trial License Form</a> on our website.</p>

<p>Please kindly note that a trial license can only be used in a <strong>development and staging environment</strong>. 
You are <strong>not allowed to publish</strong> your app to the App Store, Play Store or any 3rd party Android App Store with a trial license.</p>

<h4 id="purchase-a-production-license">Purchase a Production License</h4>
<p>You can check and purchase the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK licenses here: <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk.html">https://scanbot.io/sdk.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="app-identifier">App Identifier</h4>
<p>Every app has a unique identifier (on iOS known as ‚ÄúBundle Identifier‚Äù, on Android as ‚ÄúApplication ID‚Äù). 
Your license will be bound to this identifier.
To request a trial license or purchase a production license you have to provide to us the identifier of your app.
Please find this identifier in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">config.xml</code> file of your Cordova app project:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;widget</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"my.awesome.app.id"</span> <span class="err">...</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><a name="logging"></a></p>
<h4 id="logging">Logging</h4>
<p>When initializing the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK you can enable logging of the SDK. By default logging is disabled.</p>

<p>On Android logs are printed into <em>LogCat</em> as well as saved on the device.
The easiest way to check the log outputs on Android is to use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge (adb)</a>. 
(e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ adb -s &lt;DEVICE_ID&gt; shell "logcat"</code>)</p>

<p>On iOS all logs are printed to the console. Please use Xcode to check the log outputs. 
There will be no log files created by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> While it may be useful for development, <strong>consider switching logging OFF in production builds</strong> for security and performance reasons!</p>

<h3 id="updating-license-key-in-production-apps">Updating License Key in Production Apps</h3>
<p>To renew an expired license or extend a valid license with new Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK features, you will have to update your app in the App Store or Play Store. 
The expiration date and the feature list of a license are an encrypted data part of the license key string. 
Which means a renewal or extension of a license will cause a new license key string to be generated.</p>

<p><a name="scanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseInfo"></a></p>
<h3 id="license-check-in-production-apps">License Check in Production Apps</h3>
<p>If your Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK license has expired, any call of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK API will terminate your app or result in an error. 
To prevent this you should always check for license expiration during the runtime by calling the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseInfo()</code>.
If the result of await returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">result.isLicenseValid == false</code>, you should disable any usage of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK functions or UI components in your app.
We highly recommend to implement a suitable handling of this case in your app!</p>

<h4 id="scanbotbarcodesdkgetlicenseinfo">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseInfo()</h4>
<p>Use this function to check the current state of the license. The SDK must be initialized.</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getLicenseInfo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p><a name="storage"></a></p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>By default the native Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDKs as well as the Plugin itself use the internal and secure 
storage locations for all snapped barcode image files.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On <strong>Android</strong> all files will be stored in the internal <strong>files</strong> directory of your application.
No permissions are required for your app to read or write files in this directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <strong>iOS</strong> all files will be stored in the <strong>Application Support</strong> folder of your application.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="customize-storage-location">Customize Storage Location</h4>

<p>It is strongly recommended to use the default storage location. However, you can overwrite the storage directory on initialization of the Plugin.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">initializeSdk</code> method can take an optional parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code> to set a custom storage location.</p>

<p>The value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code> must be a file URL (<code class="highlighter-rouge">'file:///...</code>) pointing to a valid platform-specific file system path. 
If this directory does not exist yet, the Plugin will try to create it.
To work with the file system we recommend the Cordova Plugin <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-file">cordova-plugin-file</a></p>

<p>For the full demo code please checkout our example app on GitHub.</p>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Note:</strong> When overwriting the default storage location, make sure</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have implemented a suitable storage permissions request handling on Android</li>
  <li>you fully understand the consequences regarding the accessibility (security) of the produced document files.</li>
</ul>

<p>üëâ For more details about the storage locations on Android and iOS please also see:</p>

<h4 id="storage-cleanup">Storage Cleanup</h4>

<p>There is <strong>no automatic</strong> file clean mechanism in this Plugin, because only your app can decide when is the perfect time 
to remove the optional barcode image files snapped by this Plugin.</p>

<p>This Plugin provides the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">cleanup()</code> to delete all optional barcode images:</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cleanup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p><a name="productionApps"></a></p>
<h2 id="building-production-apps">Building Production Apps</h2>

<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>
<p>The Scanbot SDK iOS Framework (included in this Cordova Plugin) contains the most used architectures (<code class="highlighter-rouge">arm64, armv7, x86_64, i386</code>). 
So you can run it on all most used iOS devices as well as on simulators during the development phase.
To be able to submit a production build to the <strong>App Store</strong> or a test build for <strong>TestFlight</strong> you have to remove (strip away) 
the architectures <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code></strong> and <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">i386</code></strong> from the Scanbot SDK Framework.
These architectures are only for <strong>simulators</strong> and not allowed to submit to iTunes Connect.</p>

<p>We provide a script for that, which can be found in:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>plugins/cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner/src/ios/Frameworks/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK.framework/strip-SBSDK-Framework.sh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This script removes the unnecessary architectures from the frameworks binary, code signs the framework and adds the crash symbols (dSYM) file to your apps archive.
The final package size (IPA) of your app will then be significantly smaller than a debug version used during the development phase.</p>

<p>To add this script in your build process, you need to apply a few changes in the Xcode project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the generated Xcode project file with Xcode IDE:
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;YOUR_APP_PROJECT_PATH&gt;/platforms/ios/&lt;YOUR_APP_NAME&gt;.xcodeproj</code></li>
  <li>Go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">TARGETS</code> settings and open the tab <code class="highlighter-rouge">Build Phases</code>.
Add a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run Script Phase</code> and make sure this phase is <strong>below</strong> the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Embed Frameworks</code> build phase.</li>
  <li>Adjust this <code class="highlighter-rouge">Run Script Phase</code> with the following script data:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Script code</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>bash "$BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/$FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK.framework/strip-SBSDK-Framework.sh"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>Script Input File</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$(SRCROOT)/../../plugins/cordova-plugin-scanbot-barcode-scanner/src/ios/Frameworks/ScanbotBarcodeScannerSDK.framework.dSYM
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><a href="./assets/images/cordova_xcode_build_phases_settings.png"><img src="./assets/images/cordova_xcode_build_phases_settings.png" alt="alt text" title="Xcode Build Phases settings" /></a></p>

<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>The Scanbot Android SDK uses native libraries under the hood and supports following <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/arch.html">ABIs</a>: 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86 and x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>By default the native libraries of <strong>all</strong> these architectures will be included in the app package (APK), which will result in a big APK file.
Please consider to remove support for <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> architectures. In most cases both ‚Äúx86‚Äù architectures can be removed for the 
release (production) build, since they are only used on emulators and on some rare devices with the Intel Atom architecture.</p>

<p>To exclude certain ABIs from the APK, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> property in the Android Gradle settings of your project.
To apply any custom Gradle settings on a Cordova generated Android project, create the additional custom .gradle file with the name</p>

<p><strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">platforms/android/app/build-extras.gradle</code></strong></p>

<p>and define your custom Gradle settings in it. 
In this case we define <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> to <strong>exclude</strong>  <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> architectures:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ext.postBuildExtras = {
    android.defaultConfig.ndk.abiFilters = ["armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a"]
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>üí° However, if you need to support <strong>all</strong> architectures and to optimize the APK size in any case, we highly recommend to 
checkout the <a href="https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle/"><strong>Android App Bundle</strong></a> approach. 
It allows you to create and distribute dedicated and smaller APKs <strong>via PlayStore</strong> (basically it‚Äôs similar to the iOS App Store approach).</p>

<h4 id="proguard">ProGuard</h4>

<p>If you have ProGuard / R8 enabled for the <strong>release build</strong>, you will need to add the following rules 
to cover the classes of this Cordova plugin as well as of the native Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Android:</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk">Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK</a> brings barcode scanning capabilities to your mobile apps.</p>

<p>The Flutter plugin <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/barcode_scanner"><code class="highlighter-rouge">barcode_scanner</code></a> provides the implementation
of the native Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Android and iOS.</p>

<p>The following functionality is covered by this Flutter plugin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scanning of 1D and 2D barcodes via ready-to-use scanner UI</li>
  <li>Recognition of 1D and 2D barcodes on still images (e.g. JPG files)</li>
  <li>Support for multiple barcode scanning and recognition</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="supported-barcode-types">Supported Barcode Types</h3>
<h4 id="1d-barcodes">1D Barcodes</h4>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<h4 id="dev-tools">Dev Tools</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Latest <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter SDK</a></li>
  <li>For Android apps: Android SDK (API Level 21+), Platforms and Developer Tools</li>
  <li>For iOS apps: Mac OS with latest Xcode and Command Line Tools</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mobile-platforms">Mobile Platforms</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Android 5.0 (API Level 21) and higher</li>
  <li>iOS 9 and higher</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This Plugin and the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK are available only for Android and iOS</li>
  <li>We <strong>do not support</strong> rooted Android devices (custom ROMs)</li>
  <li>This Plugin <strong>does not work</strong> on other platforms like Windows Phone, Desktop or Web Apps</li>
  <li>Also, the Plugin <strong>does not work</strong> in a Flutter Hummingbird and macOS versions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mobile-devices">Mobile Devices</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Smartphones and Tablets with a <strong>rear-facing camera with autofocus</strong></li>
  <li>Supported CPUs and Architectures:
    <ul>
      <li>Android: <code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64</code></li>
      <li>iOS: <code class="highlighter-rouge">arm64, armv7, x86_64, i386</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="no-internet-connection-required">No Internet Connection Required</h4>
<p><strong>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK works completely offline.</strong> It does not even contain any networking code.
This can easily be verified by routing all networking traffic coming from the app through a proxy.
All data generated by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is only stored on the end user’s device and in absolutely no case ever
transferred to a server / cloud service controlled by us. You as the customer will need to take care of uploading
the scans / data to your backend, if desired.</p>

<h4 id="simulators--emulators">Simulators / Emulators</h4>
<p>While it is possible to test your App with the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Plugin on simulators/emulators, we strongly recommend you use real Android/iOS devices.
Depending on the emulated Camera you may not be able to test/evaluate the full functionality of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Plugin.</p>

<p><a name="licenseKey"></a></p>
<h4 id="license-key">License Key</h4>
<p>In order to run the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK plugin functionality within your production app you have to purchase and use a valid Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK license.</p>

<p>Each license key is valid only for a given app bundle identifier. The license also defines which modules you are allowed to use.
The usage of unlicensed modules will log an error to the console and terminate the app. If your license has expired any calls
of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK plugin will terminate your app.</p>

<h4 id="trial-license">Trial License</h4>
<p>The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!
To get an unrestricted, “no-strings-attached” 30 day trial license, please submit the <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk/trial.html">Trial License Form</a> on our website.</p>

<p>Please kindly note that a trial license can only be used in a <strong>development and staging environment</strong>.
You are <strong>not allowed to publish</strong> your app to the App Store, Play Store or any 3rd party Android App Store with a trial license.</p>

<h4 id="purchase-a-production-license">Purchase a Production License</h4>
<p>You can check and purchase the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK licenses here: <a href="https://scanbot.io/sdk.html">https://scanbot.io/sdk.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="app-identifier">App Identifier</h4>
<p>Every app has a unique identifier (sometimes also known as “bundle identifier” or “application ID”). Your license will be bound to this identifier.
To request a trial license or purchase a production license you have to provide us the bundle identifier of your app.</p>

<p><strong>For Android:</strong> Please see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">applicationId</code> in the app-level <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.gradle</code> file of your android project:</p>

<div class="language-groovy highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">defaultConfig</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="n">applicationId</span> <span class="s2">"io.scanbot.barcode.example.app.flutter"</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>For iOS:</strong> In Xcode see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Bundle Identifier</code> in the “General” settings tab of your project.</p>

<p><a name="logging"></a></p>
<h4 id="logging">Logging</h4>
<p>When initializing the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK you can enable logging of the SDK. By default logging is disabled.</p>

<div class="language-dart highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ScanbotSdkConfig</span><span class="o">(</span>
  <span class="nl">loggingEnabled:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">initScanbotSdk</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On Android logs are printed into <em>LogCat</em> as well as saved on the device.
The easiest way to check the log outputs on Android is to use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge (adb)</a>.
(e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ adb -s &lt;DEVICE_ID&gt; shell "logcat"</code>)</p>

<p>On iOS all logs are printed to the console. Please use Xcode to check the log outputs.
There will be no log files created by the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> While it may be useful for development, <strong>consider switching logging OFF in production builds</strong> for security and performance reasons!</p>

<h3 id="updating-license-key-in-production-apps">Updating License Key in Production Apps</h3>
<p>To renew an expired license or extend a valid license with new Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK features, you will have to update your app in the App Store or Play Store.
The expiration date and the feature list of a license are contained in an encrypted data part of the license key string.
This means a renewal or extension of a license will cause a new license key string to be generated.</p>

<p><a name="module_ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseStatus"></a></p>
<h3 id="license-check-in-production-apps">License Check in Production Apps</h3>
<p>If your Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK license has expired, any call of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK API will terminate your app or result in an error.
To prevent this you should always check for license expiration during the runtime by calling the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseStatus()</code>.
If the result of await returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">result.isLicenseValid == false</code>, you should disable any usage of the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK functions or UI components in your app.
We highly recommend implementing a suitable handling of this case in your app!</p>

<h4 id="scanbotbarcodesdkgetlicensestatus">ScanbotBarcodeSdk.getLicenseStatus()</h4>
<p>Use this function to check the current state of the license. The SDK must be initialized.</p>

<div class="language-dart highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">await</span> <span class="n">ScanbotBarcodeSdk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getLicenseStatus</span><span class="o">();</span>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">result.isLicenseValid</code> : Contains a boolean status value of the license.

<p><a name="storage"></a></p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>By default the native Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDKs as well as the Plugin itself use the internal and secure
storage locations for all snapped barcode image files.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On <strong>Android</strong> all files will be stored in the internal <strong>files</strong> directory of your application.
No permissions are required for your app to read or write files in this directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On <strong>iOS</strong> all files will be stored in the <strong>Application Support</strong> folder of your application.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="customize-storage-location">Customize Storage Location</h4>

<p>It is strongly recommended to use the default storage location. However, you can override the storage directory on initialization of the Plugin.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">initializeSdk</code> method can take an optional parameter <code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code> to set a custom storage location.</p>

<div class="language-dart highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">Directory</span> <span class="n">storageDirectory</span><span class="o">;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">storageBaseDirectory</code> must be a file URL (<code class="highlighter-rouge">'file:///...</code>) pointing to a valid platform-specific file system path.
If this directory does not exist yet, the Plugin will try to create it.
To work with the file system we recommend the Flutter Plugin <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider">path_provider</a></p>

<p>For the full demo code please checkout our example app on GitHub.</p>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Note:</strong> When overriding the default storage location, make sure</p>
<ul>
  <li>you have implemented a suitable storage permissions request handling on Android</li>
  <li>you fully understand the consequences regarding the accessibility (security) of the produced document files</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="storage-cleanup">Storage Cleanup</h4>

<p>There is <strong>no automatic</strong> file clean mechanism in this Plugin. Your app should decide when the perfect time
is to remove the optional barcode image files snapped by this Plugin.</p>

<p>To avoid storage space issues caused by too many produced image files, it is strongly recommended implementing a suitable
cleanup functionality based on the requirements of your app.
This Plugin provides the following helper methods to keep the storage clean:</p>

To be able to submit a production build to the <strong>App Store</strong> or a test build for <strong>TestFlight</strong> you have to remove (strip away)
the architectures <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code></strong> and <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">i386</code></strong> from the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK Framework.
These architectures are only for <strong>simulators</strong> and not allowed to be submitted to iTunes Connect.</p>

<p>The Scanbot Android SDK uses native libraries under the hood and supports the following <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/arch.html">ABIs</a>:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86 and x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>By default the native libraries of <strong>all</strong> these architectures will be included in the app package (APK), which will result in a larger APK file.
Please consider removing support for <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> architectures. In most cases both “x86” architectures can be removed for the
release (production) build, since they are only used on emulators and on some rare devices with the Intel Atom architecture.</p>

<p>To exclude certain ABIs from the APK, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> property in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">android/app/build.gradle</code> file of your project:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    ndk {
      abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a"
        // Please add "x86" and "x86_64" if you would like to test on an emulator
        // or if you need to support some rare devices with the Intel Atom architecture.
    }
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example we defined <code class="highlighter-rouge">abiFilters</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">armeabi-v7a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">arm64-v8a</code>, so <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x86_64</code> architectures will be <strong>excluded</strong>.</p>

<p>💡 However, if you need to support <strong>all</strong> architectures and would also like to optimize the APK size, we highly recommend
checking out the <a href="https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle/"><strong>Android App Bundle</strong></a> approach.
It allows you to create and distribute dedicated, smaller APKs via the <strong>PlayStore</strong> (basically, it is similar to the iOS App Store approach).</p>

<h4 id="proguard">ProGuard</h4>

<p>If you have ProGuard / R8 enabled for the <strong>release build</strong>, you will need to add the following rules
to cover the classes of this Flutter plugin as well as of the native Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK for Android:</p>
